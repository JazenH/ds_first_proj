# Salary Estimator Project: Project Overview

- Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $ 11K) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
- Scraped job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium
- Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark.
- Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.
- Built a client facing API using flask

## Web Scraping

Tweaked the web scraper github repo (above) to scrape 1000 job postings from glassdoor.com. With each job, we got the following:
- Job title
- Salary Estimate
- Job Description
- Rating
- Company
- Location
- Company Headquarters
- Company Size
- Company Founded Date
- Type of Ownership
- Industry
- Sector
- Revenue
- Competitors

## Data Cleaning and Engineering

I needed to clean it up so that it was usable for our model. I made the following changes and created the following variables:

- **Parsed numeric data out of salary**
  - The original data contains symbles not suit for analysis
- **Made columns for employer provided salary and hourly wages**
- **Removed rows without salary**
- **Parsed rating out of company text**
  - Rating column existed. The company text also contributes in analysis
- **Made a new column for company state**
  - Location, location, location
- **Added a column for if the job was at the companyâ€™s headquarters**
- **Transformed founded date into age of company**
- **Made columns for if different skills were listed in the job description:** Python, R, Excel, AWS, Spark
- **Column for simplified job title and Seniority**
- **Column for description length**
  - elaborare description reveals the urgent degree or the earnest of the company, could affect the salary
